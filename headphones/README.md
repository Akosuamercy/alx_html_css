## Introduction

Building a web page the right way involves laying down solid foundations. This README outlines best practices for structuring your CSS and HTML, ensuring your web pages are not only functional but also easy to maintain and scale.

## Key Principles

### 1. Reset CSS Styling

Start by using a CSS reset to eliminate browser inconsistencies in default styling. This helps ensure that your web page looks consistent across different browsers.

### 2. Use Variables

Utilize CSS variables to manage colors, fonts, and other design elements. This makes it easier to maintain and update your styles in one place.

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3498db;
    --font-family: 'Arial, sans-serif';
}
```

### 3. Simple CSS Selectors

Favor simple and generic selectors. This improves readability and maintainability while ensuring that styles apply broadly without unnecessary complexity.

### 4. Avoid Super Specific Selectors

Overly specific selectors can lead to complications down the road. Strive for clarity and avoid specificity wars by keeping selectors straightforward.

### 5. Simple HTML Structure

Use a clean HTML structure with div containers to maintain organization. This makes it easier to navigate and update your layout.

## Development Approach

When starting a new web page, I recommend building from the outside in and from top to bottom. This method provides a clear structure and helps prevent confusion with HTML tags. However, feel free to experiment with your own approach if it works better for you!

## First Task: Create the Header/Hero Piece

Now it's your turn! For your first task, focus on creating the header/hero section of your web page. This is a crucial area that sets the tone for the rest of the site.

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Structure the HTML**: Create a clean layout for your header.
2. **Style with CSS**: Apply your styles, using the principles outlined above.
3. **Utilize the Assets**: Use the provided images for your header design.
